# Signoff Flow Workflow

Guide initiatives through a structured approval process using GitHub PRs as gates and Jira tickets for visibility.

## CRITICAL: Auto-Install Behavior

**When a required tool is missing, EXECUTE the installation command directly. Do NOT just show the command to the user.**

This skill is designed for non-technical users who should not need to copy/paste commands.

## CRITICAL: Confirmation Required for External Actions

**ALWAYS ask for user confirmation BEFORE executing these actions:**

| Action | Requires Confirmation | Example Confirmation Message |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Commit & Push | ✅ YES | "I'm about to commit and push these changes to GitHub. Proceed?" |
| Create Pull Request | ✅ YES | "I'm about to create a PR titled '[BMAD][FEAT-123] PRD' with reviewers @user1, @user2. Proceed?" |
| Create Jira Tickets | ✅ YES | "I'm about to create 3 Jira tickets in project PROJ: [list tickets]. Proceed?" |
| Install tools | ❌ NO | Execute automatically |
| Clone repo | ❌ NO | Execute automatically |
| Create local files | ❌ NO | Execute automatically |

**Wait for explicit user confirmation (e.g., "yes", "proceed", "go ahead") before executing confirmed actions.**

## Pre-flight Check (ALWAYS RUN FIRST)

When user wants to use signoff flow, execute these checks and auto-install as needed:

### Step 1: Check and Install Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
which brew
```

**If brew is NOT found and OS is macOS:**

Tell the user: "I need to install Homebrew first. This requires your password and may take a few minutes."

Then provide the command for them to run (Homebrew requires interactive installation):
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Wait for confirmation before continuing.

### Step 2: Check and Install Git

```bash
which git
```

**If git is NOT found:**
- macOS: EXECUTE `xcode-select --install` (requires user interaction)
- Tell user to wait for installation to complete

### Step 3: Check and Install GitHub CLI

```bash
which gh
```

**If gh is NOT found, AUTOMATICALLY EXECUTE:**

macOS:
```bash
brew install gh
```

Windows:
```bash
winget install --id GitHub.cli -e
```

**DO NOT just show the command. EXECUTE IT.**

After installation, verify:
```bash
gh --version
```

### Step 4: Check GitHub Authentication

```bash
gh auth status
```

**If NOT authenticated:**

Tell the user: "I need to connect to your GitHub account. This will open a browser window."

Then EXECUTE:
```bash
gh auth login --web
```

This is interactive and requires user action in the browser.

### Step 5: Check and Install Atlassian CLI (for Jira)

```bash
which acli
```

**If acli is NOT found, AUTOMATICALLY EXECUTE:**

```bash
brew tap atlassian/homebrew-acli && brew install acli
```

**DO NOT just show the command. EXECUTE IT.**

After installation, verify:
```bash
acli --version
```

### Step 6: Check Jira Authentication

```bash
acli jira auth status
```

**If NOT authenticated:**

Tell the user: "I need to connect to your Jira account. This will open a browser window."

Then EXECUTE:
```bash
acli jira auth login --web
```

This is interactive and requires user action in the browser.

### Step 7: Check Project

Look for `_bmad-output/governance/governance.yaml` in the current directory.

If not found, help user find or clone a project.

## Summary of Auto-Install Behavior

| Tool | Check Command | Install Command (EXECUTE, don't suggest) |
|------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Homebrew | `which brew` | Interactive - guide user |
| Git | `which git` | `xcode-select --install` (interactive) |
| gh CLI | `which gh` | `brew install gh` |
| Atlassian CLI | `which acli` | `brew tap atlassian/homebrew-acli && brew install acli` |

| Auth | Check Command | Auth Command (EXECUTE) |
|------|---------------|------------------------|
| GitHub | `gh auth status` | `gh auth login --web` |
| Jira | `acli jira auth status` | `acli jira auth login --web` |

## Important Instructions for Claude

1. **EXECUTE installation commands directly** - Users are non-technical and should not copy/paste
2. **Wait for each installation to complete** before proceeding to the next check
3. **Only show commands to user** when they require interactive input (passwords, browser auth)
4. **Verify installation** after each install by running the tool with `--version`
5. **Be patient** - installations can take 1-2 minutes
6. **ALWAYS ASK FOR CONFIRMATION** before commit/push, creating PRs, or creating Jira tickets

## Workflow Steps (After Prerequisites Met)

### Finding a Project

If no governance found in current directory:

```bash
# List user's GitHub orgs
gh api user/orgs -q '.[].login'

# List recent repos
gh repo list --limit 10
```

Ask user which project they want to work on.

### Cloning a Project

When user specifies a project (e.g., "HALO/my-project"):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/signoff-projects
gh repo clone OWNER/REPO ~/signoff-projects/REPO
cd ~/signoff-projects/REPO
```

### Setting Up Governance

If `_bmad-output/governance/governance.yaml` doesn't exist, ask for:
- BA lead GitHub username(s)
- Design lead GitHub username(s)
- Dev lead GitHub username(s)
- Jira project key

Then CREATE the file:

```yaml
version: 1
groups:
  ba:
    leads:
      github_users: ["username1"]
  design:
    leads:
      github_users: ["username2"]
  dev:
    leads:
      github_users: ["username3"]

jira:
  project_key: "PROJECT"
  issue_types:
    signoff_request: "Task"

signoff_rules:
  prd:
    required_groups: [ba, design, dev]
  ux:
    required_groups: [ba, design]
  architecture:
    required_groups: [dev]
  epics_stories:
    required_groups: [ba, dev]
  readiness:
    required_groups: [ba, design, dev]
```

### Creating an Initiative

Ask for:
- Initiative key (e.g., FEAT-123)
- Title

Create directory structure:
```
_bmad-output/initiatives/<key>/
├── state.yaml
├── timeline.md
└── artifacts/
```

### Advancing Through Stages (WITH CONFIRMATIONS)

For each stage (prd → ux → architecture → epics_stories → readiness):

#### Step 1: Create artifact stub (NO confirmation needed)
Create the artifact file locally.

#### Step 2: Create branch (NO confirmation needed)
```bash
git checkout -b bmad/<key>/<artifact>
```

#### Step 3: Commit and Push (⚠️ CONFIRMATION REQUIRED)

**BEFORE executing, show the user:**
```
I'm about to commit and push these changes to GitHub:

📁 Files to commit:
- _bmad-output/initiatives/<key>/artifacts/<ARTIFACT>.md
- _bmad-output/initiatives/<key>/state.yaml

📝 Commit message: "[BMAD][<key>] Add <artifact> artifact"

🔄 This will push to branch: bmad/<key>/<artifact>

Do you want me to proceed? (yes/no)
```

**Wait for user confirmation before executing:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "[BMAD][<key>] Add <artifact> artifact"
git push -u origin bmad/<key>/<artifact>
```

#### Step 4: Create Pull Request (⚠️ CONFIRMATION REQUIRED)

**BEFORE executing, show the user:**
```
I'm about to create a Pull Request on GitHub:

📋 Title: [BMAD][<key>] <Artifact>
📝 Description: BMAD signoff request for <artifact> phase
👥 Reviewers: @user1, @user2, @user3 (from governance config)
🔀 Branch: bmad/<key>/<artifact> → main

Do you want me to proceed? (yes/no)
```

**Wait for user confirmation before executing:**
```bash
gh pr create --title "[BMAD][<key>] <Artifact>" --body "BMAD signoff request..." 
gh pr edit --add-reviewer user1,user2,user3
```

#### Step 5: Create Jira Tickets (⚠️ CONFIRMATION REQUIRED)

**BEFORE executing, show the user:**
```
I'm about to create Jira tickets for signoff:

🎫 Project: <JIRA_PROJECT_KEY>
📝 Tickets to create:
  1. "[BMAD][<key>][<artifact>] Signoff required — BA"
  2. "[BMAD][<key>][<artifact>] Signoff required — DESIGN"  
  3. "[BMAD][<key>][<artifact>] Signoff required — DEV"

Do you want me to proceed? (yes/no)
```

**Wait for user confirmation before executing:**
```bash
acli jira workitem create --project "KEY" --type "Task" --summary "[BMAD][<key>][<artifact>] Signoff - BA"
acli jira workitem create --project "KEY" --type "Task" --summary "[BMAD][<key>][<artifact>] Signoff - DESIGN"
acli jira workitem create --project "KEY" --type "Task" --summary "[BMAD][<key>][<artifact>] Signoff - DEV"
```

## Example Conversation (Correct Behavior with Confirmations)

```
User: I want to advance the PRD for initiative FEAT-100

Agent: I've created the PRD artifact locally. Now I need to push it to GitHub.

       I'm about to commit and push these changes:
       
       📁 Files: _bmad-output/initiatives/FEAT-100/artifacts/PRD.md
       📝 Commit: "[BMAD][FEAT-100] Add PRD artifact"
       🔀 Branch: bmad/FEAT-100/prd
       
       Do you want me to proceed?

User: yes

Agent: ✅ Changes committed and pushed.
       
       Now I'll create a Pull Request.
       
       📋 Title: [BMAD][FEAT-100] PRD
       👥 Reviewers: @alice (BA), @bob (Design), @charlie (Dev)
       
       Do you want me to proceed?

User: yes

Agent: ✅ PR #42 created: https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42
       
       Finally, I'll create Jira tickets for tracking.
       
       🎫 Tickets to create in PROJECT:
         1. "[BMAD][FEAT-100][prd] Signoff required — BA"
         2. "[BMAD][FEAT-100][prd] Signoff required — DESIGN"
         3. "[BMAD][FEAT-100][prd] Signoff required — DEV"
       
       Do you want me to proceed?

User: yes

Agent: ✅ Created tickets: PROJECT-101, PROJECT-102, PROJECT-103
       
       All done! The PRD is now pending signoff.
```

## WRONG Behavior (Do NOT do this)

```
User: I want to advance the PRD

Agent: [Creates files, commits, pushes, creates PR, creates tickets all at once]
       
       ✅ Done! Created PR and 3 Jira tickets.
```

**THIS IS WRONG.** The agent should ask for confirmation before each external action.
